        &ensp; About:
      </p>
      <p>
        As a seasoned software developer, I have a strong background in developing, maintaining, and innovating across various technologies and platforms. 
        My expertise spans C#, .NET, SQL, Azure, Python, and modern JavaScript frameworks like React and Angular. I've gained significant experience in both 
        front-end and back-end development, focusing on creating and enhancing web applications, automating workflows, and integrating cloud-based solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout my career, I’ve led small teams to deliver complex solutions, particularly in environments requiring high reliability and performance, 
        such as financial trading systems and enterprise applications. I’ve played a critical role in deploying and maintaining cloud infrastructure, 
        utilizing Azure for tasks like setting up virtual machines, databases, and automated deployment pipelines.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve worked across diverse industries, including banking and financial services, where I developed and maintained trading and legal department 
        applications, and real estate management, where I built tools to manage client systems and data. Additionally, I’ve contributed to the modernization 
        of legacy systems, transitioning them to more agile, scalable, and user-friendly architectures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, my career reflects a strong ability to adapt to new challenges, work collaboratively across departments, and continuously innovate to 
        meet business needs with technical solutions.

        This is a personal website built for a few objectives. To act as an easy to reach cv along with pages to show past and current works and interests. Also, for the longest time I have
        wanted a hosted space for my wife and friends to use programs I wrote for our individual needs and organization. I also plan to get a personal blog and ranting space here soon.

        The current goal is to work on some extra projects for my wife and her career. Revit can have addons custom made for users. I plan to make a few to make her life easier and posting
        results as I go. BIM has been extremely interesting. I can't help but try to learn more. The industry seems to have plenty of room to grow.
